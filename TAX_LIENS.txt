Message to Lawyers:
Hello,

I am an investor looking to enter the market of purchasing tax liens.  I am new to this investment strategy and am eager to learn more about the legal implciations around it in the Fox Valley area.  If any tax attorney in the Fox Valley area from your organization would have 30 minutes to lend I would love to buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brain on tax liens.

I greatly appreciate your time taken to read and respond to this email.  Please feel free to contact me by either email (brentonsreilly@gmail.com) or phone (262-225-7851).

Thank you,

Brenton Reilly
